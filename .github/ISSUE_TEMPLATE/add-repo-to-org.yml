        ## Add Repository To Organization

        Use this issue to request a new repository created from a template owned by this GitHub organization. After creating the issue, a member of the IssueOps approver team must add a comment with the `.approve` command. The workflow will create the repository, add a `development` branch, and comment on this issue with the result.

        **Instructions**:
        - Use the fields below to draft the repository details.
        - Once complete, enter a comment with the command '.submit'.  This will submit the issue to the approval users.
        - Only approved users can trigger the repository creation.
        - If approved, the approver will enter a comment with the command '.approve'.  This will initiate the creation of the new repository.
        - If denied, the approver will enter a comment with the command '.deny'.  This will close the issue and enter a comment that the request was denied.
